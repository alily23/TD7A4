Note: Replace my-image with the name of the Docker image you built in step 3.

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 to confirm that your container is running.

Stop the container.

Copy code
docker stop $(docker ps -q --filter ancestor=my-image)
Note: Replace my-image with the name of the Docker image you built in step 3.

Run the Docker container using Docker Compose.
